Identifying the victim as ex-Met Officer, John Warnock, the only clues are an empty flat and an unregistered car with six thousand pounds hidden in the boot. With the help of her loyal team, they track John's next of kin to a local farm run by his sister, Maggie. Having recently returned to Newcastle, John had been working at Finches, a large brewery run by Maggie's fianc\u00e9, Sam Harper. Lisa Strachan, John's childhood sweetheart, admits to rekindling their affair in recent months. Delving deeper into John's world, Vera uncovers a secret relationship with Sam's daughter, Eva and an under-hand plot to spy on the brewery for a multi-national company eager to buy out the family business. But lawyer Katrina Lennox insists he was called off the case months ago. So why did he continue to spy on Sam Harper?</p>",

But there's something strange about this number. It belongs to Theresa Whitaker -- a teenage girl who was murdered two years ago. Finch claims his machine is never wrong. So why is it pointing them toward someone that it's too late to save? What does the machine know that they don't? With Detective Carter still hunting them down, Reese and Finch begin to find out what really happened to Theresa -- and discover that they might still have a chance to be there in time.</p>",

But Reese and Finch soon discover that even though Joey's off the battlefield, he's still putting himself in the line of fire. It seems Joey and his army buddies are using the skills they learned in combat to commit daring heists in New York. According to Finch's machine, Joey's about to kill or be killed -- so Reese infiltrates the group to find out which. With Detective Carter hot on his trail, Reese is closer to getting captured than ever before as he goes on a high-risk mission that puts his life -- and Finch's -- in danger.</p>",
